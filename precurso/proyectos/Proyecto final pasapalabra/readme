Skylab coders final precourse project. Pasapalabra game.

How does it work?
You will have a letter panel from A to Z, each letter has a question wich answer starts or has that letter.
If you dont know the answer of the question, just press pasa-palabra in order to reach the next question. Otherwise just write the
answer in the input box and if correct, background letter turns to green, if fail, just turns to red.
If you complete the panel, you will be asked to play again or not.
